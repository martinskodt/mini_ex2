# mini_ex2
This is my first little program. A reconstruction of the scene from the movie "The Matrix", where there happens a alteration in the Matrix. and a cat goes by twice creating deja vu.

## Coding process
My process is very simplistic right now. I use the very few tools i have in coding, to create something that lives up to my own standard.
I wanted to create an image of the first thing i thought of when i saw the excersise. The screen from Matrix where dejavu is the result of a alteration in the Matrix. So i made a cat, using simple shapes and kinda guessed my way though the coordinate system. After that i got som text to create som context. Finally i found a way to move the cat back forth, using the sinus equation, on the x axis. Which was a nice way to create the image i was looking for.

## What constitutes a program?
There is probably a very nice definition to that question. But i think it is, in its simplicity, a piece of independent software that create some form of algorithm. That algorithem can do simpel stuff. Such as show a square on a blank canvas, or advanced stuff as an anti virus program. and independent does not mean that it can't rely on other software to do the task. But all programs is that advanced.

## Reflect on the notion of error
Error is often given as a form of deviation of the intention. When it happens in a digital media, a user or a spectator becomes aware of their using of the media and a interruption of immersion happens. But errors can come in many forms in the media of programs. They can be minor annoyances and imperfections, or they can be critical errors that disrupts an entire program. Errors in programs are offen attempts at something, that is not yet fully understood or perfectly intergrated to the existing code. It is "the actualisation of unforeseen potential" (T. Baker, "Error,the unforseen and the emergent")
