## Coding process
My process is very simplistic right now. i use the very few tools i have to create something that lives up to my own standard.
I try to think my way to getting the coordinates i need, to coding the shapes the right way. After finnihing the shapes i play
with the colors. With the fill and stroke tools.

## What constitutes a program?
There is probably a very nice definition to that question. But i think it is, in its simplicity, a piece of independent software that create some form of algorithm. That algorithem can do simpel stuff. Such as show a square on a blank canvas, or advanced stuff as an anti virus program. and independent does not mean that it can't rely on other software to do the task. But all programs is that advanced.
